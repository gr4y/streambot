= Installation

the streambot gem is available on rubygems.org[http://rubygems.org/gems/streambot]
to get streambot installed, you simply need to run

== stable release

    gem install streambot

== development release

    gem install streambot --pre

= Documentation

The full rdoc is available on rdoc.info[http://rdoc.info/projects/gr4y/streambot]

= Usage

    require 'streambot'

	@params = { 'auth' => { 'username' => 'your username', 'password' => 'your password' },
	 			'oauth' => { 'key' => 'your consumer key', 'secret' => 'your consumer secret' },
	 			'keywords' => ['nowplaying'] }
    bot = StreamBot::Tracker.new(@params)
    bot.start

= Configuration

Twitter has finally removed the http basic authentication for the REST API.
The Streaming API, which the tracker is using, still works with http basic authentication only.
So we still need both, the oauth credentials for retweeting and the http basic authentication credentials for tracking. 

You need to register an application of the type desktop application on http://dev.twitter.com first!

=== oauth

*key*:: The consumer key Twitter provides you
*secret*:: The consumer secret Twitter provides you

=== auth
*username*:: Your login username
*password*:: Your login password

=== keywords 
:: the list of keywords as an array

=== filters_config
:: the path to the filters.yml file

I wrote this stuff into my config.yml and load the params with 

	require 'yaml'
	@params = YAML.load_file('config.yml')

= Callbacks

*on_error*:: this callback is fired when an error occures

= Filters

You need to configure the *filters_config* in the params and set the path to the YAML file. At the moment this needs to be an YAML file, cause the tracker is reading this file, every time a new status comes in via the client. I decided to read it on each status, cause I don't wanted to restart the Tracker every time I made a change to the filters.

For example we want to filter all tweets with the source "web", we need to define the following line in our *filters.yml*

	"source": "web"

The Tracker checks if the field "source" of the incoming status *includes* OR *is equal* to "web". If you want to filter more than one source, you simply need to write it this way:

	"source": ["web", "TweetDeck"]

You can define all fields inside the status object. You want to filter tweets by me, so you need to define

	"user/screen_name": "gr4y"

You can even filter all tweets of users with an evil background color.

	"user/profile_background_color": "666666"

= Example

	@params = YAML.load_file('config.yml')
	@client = StreamBot::Tracker.new(@params)
	
	@client.on_error doÂ |msg, stacktrace|
		puts msg
		puts stacktrace
	end

All Tests should inherit from StreamBot::BaseTest

== Feature Requests / Issues

If you ran into some errors? Then don't be shy and file an issue in the issue-tracker[http://github.com/gr4y/streambot/issues]
Maybe you have a feature request then file an issue too.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

You want to add a feature or you want to patch streambot? 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
